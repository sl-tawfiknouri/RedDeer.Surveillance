Feature: HighVolume Market Capitalisation Sensitive Parameters
	In order to meet MAR compliance requirements
	I need to be able to detect when traders are executing trades
	At a volume where they are able to exert market manipulating pressure
	on the prices the market is trading at
	By measuring their security trades relative to the market cap of the underlying company

Background:
	Given I have the high volume rule parameter values
	| WindowHours | HighVolumePercentageDaily | HighVolumePercentageWindow | HighVolumePercentageMarketCap |  
	| 1           |							  |		                       | 0.1						   |

Scenario: Empty Universe yields no alerts
	Given I have the orders for a universe from 01/01/2018 to 03/01/2018 :
	| SecurityName | OrderId | PlacedDate          | BookedDate | AmendedDate | RejectedDate | CancelledDate | FilledDate          | Type   | Direction | Currency | LimitPrice | AverageFillPrice | OrderedVolume | FilledVolume |
	When I run the high volume rule
	Then I will have 0 high volume alerts
