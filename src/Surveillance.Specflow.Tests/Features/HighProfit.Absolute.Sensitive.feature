Feature: HighProfit Absolute Sensitive Parameters
	In order to meet MAR compliance requirements
	I need to be able to detect when traders are executing trades
	Which generate unusual levels of profits
	By measuring their security trade profits as an absolute return

#High profit rule alerts have twice as many alerts to account for market closure analysis
#This is deduplicated elsewhere in the rules process

Background:
	Given I have the high profit rule parameter values
	| WindowHours | HighProfitPercentage | HighProfitAbsolute | HighProfitCurrency | HighProfitUseCurrencyConversions |
	| 1           |                      | 1000               | GBX                | false                            |
